# Array Sort

Challenge instructions are repasted below the solution.

## Solution

I began my making a struct that would hold a 13-byte flag piece, and the value of the flag used to sort the array.
```
#pragma pack(1)
    struct Group {
        short value;
        unsigned char flag[13];
    };
```
In my main function, I opened the binary file with file i/o, and read in all the values and flagpieces into a temporary struct. After the information is read into a struct, I printed the output of the value and flagpiece out to the terminal in csv format so I could easily convert it to a spreadsheet.

```
int main()
{
    Group r;
    FILE *f;
	  f = fopen("input_stream.bin", "rb");

    for (int i=0; i<99; i++)
    {
        fread(&r, sizeof(struct Group),1,f);
        cout << r.value << ",";
        for (int j = 0; j < 13; j++)
        {
            printf("%02x", r.flag[12-j]);
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

I copied the output from the terminal to an Excel sheet and sorted by the value column. Next, I deleted the odd-index rows from the spreadsheet, and I copied the sorted hexadecimal values into an ASCII hex decoder.

Notes:
To make this solution complete (without the need for spreadsheeting), I would add code that stores the value-flagpiece structs into an array and create a sort function to sort the structs. From there, I could index through the array, add 2 to the index each time, xor the flagpieces, and store this result into a char array variable to be printed out to the terminal.




## Challenge Instructions

## Overview
Write a sorting algorithm which will open the file `input_stream.bin`, load in an array which has been serialized, and sort the array from lowest to highest. The flag can be printed out using the secondary data fields of the array elements. 

Note: Those who wish to succeed on the interview should be able to accomplish this in C.

## Instructions
### Reading the Array
You have been provided the binary file, `input_stream.bin`. This file contains an array which has been serialized (meaning transferred into raw binary data).

Each array element takes the following form:
```
| Value |   Flag Piece   |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |...| 14 |
```

Value: The value which should be used to sort the array.
Flag Piece: You will use these 13-bytes to generate the flag once the array is sorted.

The first piece of the array will begin at the start of the binary file (offset 0).


### Printing the Flag
The flag is generated by XORing together the Flag Pieces of all of the elements that fall on an even index in the array. Please note that Values are meant for sorting, and may or may not correspond with their respective indexes in the array.

The flag will be represented in ASCII.

Example of a sorted array:
```
Index 0: |0|fe7f2ccb8a...|
Index 1: |1|abcdef0123...|
Index 2: |5|98134dacf1...|
```

XORing the Flag Pieces from index 0 and 2 yield: flag{...
